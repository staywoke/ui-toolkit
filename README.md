# UI Toolkit

> Vue.js UI Toolkit for Rapid Project Development of StayWoke Projects.

Overview
---

This project is the home for all StayWoke Vue.js 2 Components in our UI Toolkit. It is not set up to be a complete Web Application, but rather a collection of parts you can use to speed up development of your own.


Sample Project
---

We felt it would help to see how you would implement our UI Toolkit in the "Real World" so we made a Sample Project that uses our UI ToolKit to get you started within minutes on making a full-blown Vue.js 2 Web Application.

UI Toolkit Components
---

> UI Toolkit uses [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) Principles. Each component has example documentation for implementing in your Vue.js 2 Project.

**Atoms**

* [Alert](./src/components/atoms/alert)
* [Button](./src/components/atoms/button)

**Molecules**

* [Button Group](./src/components/molecules/button-group)

Developer Scripts
---

> Developers of UI Toolkit really only need the following development scripts.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve interactive components with hot reload at localhost:9001
npm run storybook

# run all tests
npm test
```
