UI Toolkit â€º Welcome

> Below you will see a quick overview of what each tab in this section does.


#### Notes:

After selecting a component from the left column, this panel will update with Sample Code and Documentation for that specific component.


#### Knobs:

After selecting a component from the left column, you will see a list of possible variations of that component.  The first item in that list is called **Component Overview**.  This is a special rendering of the component that allows you to interact with the component and all its possible configuration options.  More importantly, once you have it configured how you wish, the live preview will actually generate the markup needed to create the component as you configured it.

#### Viewport:

While viewing a component, you may wish to test it's responsive layout.  Switching to the **Viewport** tab will give you an interactive tool to test different responsive conditions for the component.


#### Action Logger:

While viewing the **Component Overview** rendering of a component, if there are any events that can be tracked on that component, you will be able to test that the event is firing as expected by switching to this Action Logger tab.
